For example, use '*' for password entry. Is NA by default.}

\description{
This function will create a tcl/tk dialog box to get user input. It has been
written to be extensible so the R programmer can easily create a dialog with
any number of varaibles with custom labels and data conversion of the user
entered data. The function will return a list where the element names are
\code{vars} and the value is the user input. By default, all entry will be
converted using the \code{as.character} function. However, this can easily be
altered using the \code{fun} parameter. For example, if integers are required,
use \code{fun=c(as.integer, ...)}. It is also possible to write custom
functions that can serve as a data validation. See the examples.
